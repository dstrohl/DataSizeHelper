Data Size Helper documentation
==============================

There are three main parts to this package:
   * DataHelper:
      The DataHelper class provides for a flexible object that can be converted from unit to unit, as well as used in
      other calculations and in string formatting of units.  The DataHelper uses DataUnitManager and DataSizeCalculator
      objects.
   * DataUnitManager:
      The DataUnitManager class provides for normalization of unit text and parsing strings into their pieces (value,
      unit, and suffix).
   * DataSizeCalculator:
      The DataSizeCalculator handles converting from one unit to another, If you only need to convert from 'Mb' to 'KB'
      for example, all you would need is the calculator.
