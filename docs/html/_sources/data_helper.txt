Data Size Helper
================

The key object in the package is the DataSizeHelper object.

This is probably best described with examples:

Parsing and normalizing user entered data:

    >>> dsh = DataSizeHelper('1 gig/sec')
    >>> dsh.value
    1
    >>> dsh.unit
    'Gb'
    >>> dsh.suffix
    '/s'

Converting the data to other units:

    >>> dsh = DataSizeHelper()
    >>> dsh.MB = 100
    >>> dsh.GB
    0.1
    >>> dsh.KB
    100000

Providing bit/byte size aware math services:

    >>> app1_size = DataSizeHelper('1500 MB')
    >>> app2_size = DataSizeHelper('500 MB')
    >>> app3_size = DataSizeHelper('1000 KB')
    >>> hdd_size = DataSizeHelper('1 TB')
    >>> all_apps = app1_size + app2_size + (app3_size * 5)
    >>> all_apps
    '2500 MB'
    >>> hdd_size > all_apps
    False
    >>> needed_space = all_apps - hdd_size
    >>> needed_space.MB
    '1500 MB'

Providing clean strings for user interaction:

    >>> 'The hard drive requires an additional {:n+s} of storage'.format(needed_space)
    'The hard drive requires an additional 1.5 terabytes of storage'
    >>> 'This will take approximately {:Mb+s} seconds to transfer in a 100 Mb/s network connection'.format(needed_space)
    'This will take approximately 200 seconds to transfer in a 100 Mb/s network connection'
